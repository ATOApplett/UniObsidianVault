# User stories
- Split up the functionality into groups (gameplay, user management, and system functions)
	- then assigned to each other
	- triple up in gameplay so we split it up further (gamemodes (i.e. flashcards) and rewards)
- After everyone wrote 10 user stories we reviewed and picked out at least 5 that were very high priority
- After picking out and reviewing user stories we then linked them to a core functionality
